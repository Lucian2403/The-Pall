# The Pall — M0.2 guided local verification candidate

This contains the unchanged M0.1 developer fixture with **local setup conveniences**. It is not a game, it is not a deployed server and has **not** passed the full M0 gate. The only game operation is a non-economic test counter. No approved gameplay/visuals/combat have been changed.

## Simple sequence

1. Install **Node.js 24 LTS** (official: https://nodejs.org/en/download) and have Docker Desktop running. Open a NEW terminal and check `node --version`, `npm --version`, `docker compose version`.
2. Extract the ZIP and open a terminal **inside the folder with `package.json` and `compose.yaml`**.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (Windows PowerShell: `Copy-Item .env.example .env`; macOS/Linux: `cp .env.example .env`). The `.env` file is a local-only config and should never be uploaded.
4. `npm install` (creates `package-lock.json` when online).
5. `npm run db:up` (starts a local PostgreSQL container; Docker Desktop may download the image on first run).
6. `npm run db:migrate` (creates a disposable fixture row in PostgreSQL).
7. `npm run test:unit` (runs core and contract unit tests).
8. Start **Terminal A** in this folder: `npm run dev:api`. Leave it open. Verify http://127.0.0.1:8788/health shows `{"status":"ok","module":"technical-fixture"}`.
9. Start **Terminal B** in this folder: `npm run dev:web`. Leave it open. Open http://127.0.0.1:5173 and click **Commit one test action**. The fixture value should increase by exactly one.
10. Start **Terminal C** in this folder: `npm run verify:api`. It verifies idempotency, stale conflicts, invalid input and a two-request concurrency race. It WILL increment the non-economic test counter twice by design.
11. To check persistence, record the current counter in the page. Stop Terminal A with Ctrl+C, start `npm run dev:api` again, reload the page: the number should remain.
12. To stop: Ctrl+C in Terminals A and B; optionally `npm run db:stop` in C. This stops but **does not delete** database data. Do not use `docker compose down -v` unless intentionally deleting this fixture database.

If a step fails, **stop there** and copy the error message plus the command you used. No need to install PostgreSQL separately: Docker manages it. No need to install Svelte separately: npm handles dependencies.

## Intended responsibilities

- **You:** local Node 24 installation, Docker Desktop running, commands, return output or error.
- **Assistant:** code fixes, specs, domain boundaries, QA plan and guided troubleshooting, preserving approved combat and Millhand decisions.
- **Not yet verified:** clean Node 24 build, browser interaction, live PostgreSQL tests, production security, restart evidence and GitHub commit/lockfile. These must be evidenced before calling M0 complete.

See `docs/DECISION_BOUNDARIES.md` for the policy on undecided game rules. The existing `M0_STATUS.md` describes M0.1 historical status, not the outcome of your local setup.
